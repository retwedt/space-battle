## The final project CodeAbode's 'Intro to Javascript Games' course

This website and game was the demo Capstone Project for the first CodeAbode bootcamp.  As part of the project, students were tasked with designing a simple website containing information about their game, as well as a short biography.  Students also created a simple side-scrolling game based on this example project, with freedom to create assets based on their interests.
